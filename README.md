# insomniaDiscordBOT
Full insomnia source code, python version = 3.6.9 (Discord.py rewrite) A sorta full bot to learn off of.

I've commented on code to the best of my ability, so you could maybe find some nice practices to adapt here. I'm not a good coder, nor a consistent one.

Some commands : ping, 8ball, roast, ip, hug, kick, ban, unban, roll, avatar, purge, setnick, help, invite, uptime, emojify, minecraft, wiki, servers, coin, info, say.

Feel free to use any code, note some of it is not mine and I left credits to the best of my ability. Please credit me if my bot has helped you!

Bot will be updated semi-regularly.
